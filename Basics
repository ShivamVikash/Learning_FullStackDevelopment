What is Internet?

Internet is basically interconnected network of computers around the world.
And every system on the internet has its unique address called IP address, using which the computer can traced/known.

- Server: One of the computers or systems on the internet which is available 24x7 online and returns the date which it is asked for.
- Client: System which asks the server for the data.



How are websites accessed?

Client --->  ISP  ---> DNS  (Client requests to the ISP for the IP address of the domain, further ISP request the DNS for the IP)
Client <---  ISP  <--- DNS  (DNS sends the IP as response to the ISP, and ISP sends it to the client)
Clinet ---> Sever(Domain)   (Client then directly requests the IP, and connects to the server of the domain)

* ISP - Internet Service Provider (eg: Jio, Airtel etc.)
* DNS - Domain Name System (like a global library- has IP address of all systems on internet)

[We don't necessarily need to write the domain name of a website to interact with it, we can directly write the IP address also to interact with any website.]
