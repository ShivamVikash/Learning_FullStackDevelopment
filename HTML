<p> This is a paragraph </p>
    <-----content----->
<---------Element---------->

Paragraph Elements and Heading Elements

1. The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. 
   All the text written within <p> tag are considered together, how much space you give. If spacing needs to be given between two lines of the text, multiple <p> tags can be used.

   Where <h1> being the highest and <h6> being the lowest.
   All heading elements, <h1> to <h6> have fixed and predefined sizes.
